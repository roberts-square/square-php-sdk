| `timePeriodIds` | `?(string[])` | Optional | A list of unique IDs for the catalog time periods when<br>this pricing rule is in effect. If left unset, the pricing rule is always<br>in effect. | getTimePeriodIds(): ?array | setTimePeriodIds(?array timePeriodIds): void |
| `discountId` | `?string` | Optional | Unique ID for the `CatalogDiscount` to take off<br>the price of all matched items. | getDiscountId(): ?string | setDiscountId(?string discountId): void |
| `matchProductsId` | `?string` | Optional | Unique ID for the `CatalogProductSet` that will be matched by this rule. A match rule<br>matches within the entire cart, and can match multiple times. This field will always be set. | getMatchProductsId(): ?string | setMatchProductsId(?string matchProductsId): void |
| `applyProductsId` | `?string` | Optional | __Deprecated__: Please use the `exclude_products_id` field to apply<br>an exclude set instead. Exclude sets allow better control over quantity<br>ranges and offer more flexibility for which matched items receive a discount.<br><br>`CatalogProductSet` to apply the pricing to.<br>An apply rule matches within the subset of the cart that fits the match rules (the match set).<br>An apply rule can only match once in the match set.<br>If not supplied, the pricing will be applied to all products in the match set.<br>Other products retain their base price, or a price generated by other rules. | getApplyProductsId(): ?string | setApplyProductsId(?string applyProductsId): void |
| `stackable` | [`?string (AggregationStrategy)`](../../doc/models/aggregation-strategy.md) | Optional | Indicates how a CatalogPricingRule can be combined with other pricing rules. | getStackable(): ?string | setStackable(?string stackable): void |
| `excludeProductsId` | `?string` | Optional | `CatalogProductSet` to exclude from the pricing rule.<br>An exclude rule matches within the subset of the cart that fits the match rules (the match set).<br>An exclude rule can only match once in the match set.<br>If not supplied, the pricing will be applied to all products in the match set.<br>Other products retain their base price, or a price generated by other rules. | getExcludeProductsId(): ?string | setExcludeProductsId(?string excludeProductsId): void |
| `validFromDate` | `?string` | Optional | Represents the date the Pricing Rule is valid from. Represented in RFC 3339 full-date format (YYYY-MM-DD). | getValidFromDate(): ?string | setValidFromDate(?string validFromDate): void |
| `validFromLocalTime` | `?string` | Optional | Represents the local time the pricing rule should be valid from. Represented in RFC 3339 partial-time format<br>(HH:MM:SS). Partial seconds will be truncated. | getValidFromLocalTime(): ?string | setValidFromLocalTime(?string validFromLocalTime): void |
| `validUntilDate` | `?string` | Optional | Represents the date the Pricing Rule is valid until. Represented in RFC 3339 full-date format (YYYY-MM-DD). | getValidUntilDate(): ?string | setValidUntilDate(?string validUntilDate): void |
| `validUntilLocalTime` | `?string` | Optional | Represents the local time the pricing rule should be valid until. Represented in RFC 3339 partial-time format<br>(HH:MM:SS). Partial seconds will be truncated. | getValidUntilLocalTime(): ?string | setValidUntilLocalTime(?string validUntilLocalTime): void |
| `excludeStrategy` | [`?string (ExcludeStrategy)`](../../doc/models/exclude-strategy.md) | Optional | Indicates which products matched by a CatalogPricingRule<br>will be excluded if the pricing rule uses an exclude set. | getExcludeStrategy(): ?string | setExcludeStrategy(?string excludeStrategy): void |
| `applicationMode` | [`?string (CatalogPricingRuleApplicationMode)`](../../doc/models/catalog-pricing-rule-application-mode.md) | Optional | Indicates if a PricingRule may be automatically applied, or if some other conditions must be met | getApplicationMode(): ?string | setApplicationMode(?string applicationMode): void |
| `discountTargetScope` | [`?string (DiscountTargetScope)`](../../doc/models/discount-target-scope.md) | Optional | Determines the scope at which the discounts created by the pricing rule<br>should be applied (i.e.- whole purchase or line item) | getDiscountTargetScope(): ?string | setDiscountTargetScope(?string discountTargetScope): void |
| `maxApplicationsPerAttachment` | `?int` | Optional | The maximum number of times a pricing rule may be applied for a<br>given attachment (coupon or loyalty reward)<br><br>Default value: -1 (meaning no limit) | getMaxApplicationsPerAttachment(): ?int | setMaxApplicationsPerAttachment(?int maxApplicationsPerAttachment): void |
| `minimumOrderSubtotalMoney` | [`?Money`](../../doc/models/money.md) | Optional | Represents an amount of money. `Money` fields can be signed or unsigned.<br>Fields that do not explicitly define whether they are signed or unsigned are<br>considered unsigned and can only hold positive amounts. For signed fields, the<br>sign of the value indicates the purpose of the money transfer. See<br>[Working with Monetary Amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts)<br>for more information. | getMinimumOrderSubtotalMoney(): ?Money | setMinimumOrderSubtotalMoney(?Money minimumOrderSubtotalMoney): void |
| `customerGroupIdsAny` | `?(string[])` | Optional | A list of IDs of customer groups, the members of which are eligible for discounts specified in this pricing rule.<br>Notice that a group ID is generated by the Customers API.<br>If this field is not set, the specified discount applies to matched products sold to anyone whether the buyer<br>has a customer profile created or not. If this `customer_group_ids_any` field is set, the specified discount<br>applies only to matched products sold to customers belonging to the specified customer groups. | getCustomerGroupIdsAny(): ?array | setCustomerGroupIdsAny(?array customerGroupIdsAny): void |
| `serviceChargeTargetScope` | [`?string (ServiceChargeTargetScope)`](../../doc/models/service-charge-target-scope.md) | Optional | Determines the scope at which the service charges created by the pricing rule<br>should be applied (i.e.- whole purchase or line item). | getServiceChargeTargetScope(): ?string | setServiceChargeTargetScope(?string serviceChargeTargetScope): void |
| `serviceChargeId` | `?string` | Optional | Unique ID for the `CatalogServiceCharge` to add on<br>the price of all matched items. | getServiceChargeId(): ?string | setServiceChargeId(?string serviceChargeId): void |
| `enabledPricingSources` | [`?(string[]) (CatalogPricingSource)`](../../doc/models/catalog-pricing-source.md) | Optional | The list of Order sources that a pricing rule is explicitly enabled on.<br>If unset, the pricing rule is implicitly enabled on all sources.<br>See [CatalogPricingSource](#type-catalogpricingsource) for possible values | getEnabledPricingSources(): ?array | setEnabledPricingSources(?array enabledPricingSources): void |
| `disabledPricingSources` | [`?(string[]) (CatalogPricingSource)`](../../doc/models/catalog-pricing-source.md) | Optional | The list of Order sources that a pricing rule is explicitly disabled on.<br>See [CatalogPricingSource](#type-catalogpricingsource) for possible values | getDisabledPricingSources(): ?array | setDisabledPricingSources(?array disabledPricingSources): void |
| `paymentTypes` | [`?(string[]) (PricingRulePaymentType)`](../../doc/models/pricing-rule-payment-type.md) | Optional | The list of payment types that a pricing rule should apply to.<br>See [PricingRulePaymentType](#type-pricingrulepaymenttype) for possible values | getPaymentTypes(): ?array | setPaymentTypes(?array paymentTypes): void |
